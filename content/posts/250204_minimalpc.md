## Introduction

I read an offer about used desktop hardware that peaked my interest a bit. 
A cheap, passively cooled Thin Client with dedicated graphics capability and
an AMD Ryzen CPU.  
Since I got slightly annoyed by the fan-noise of my Raspberry Pi 5 desktop 
setup, and the device seemed capable enough to fill that silence gap, 
I decided to give it a try. 

This blog entry is about what and how I set it up to get to a usable Linux 
Desktop experience from 50 Euro hardware.
