## Introduction

I read an offer about used desktop hardware that peaked my interest a bit. 
A cheap, passively-cooled Thin Client with dedicated graphics capability and
an AMD Ryzen CPU.
Since I got slightly annoyed by the fan-noise of my Raspberry Pi 5 desktop 
setup, and the device seemed capable enough to fill that silence gap, 
I decided to give it a try. 

This blog entry is about what and how I set it up to get to a usable Linux 
Desktop experience from 50 Euro hardware. 

## Hardware

The thin client PC itself is an HP t640 Thin Client, with the following specs: 

- AMD Ryzen R1505G CPU with 3.3GHz max
- 2 cores with 4 threads
- Radeon Vega 3 GPU
- up to 3 4K 60Hz displays via display port (!)
- up to 32GB RAM via 2 SODIMM slots
- an M.2 slot for storage
- luckily mine came with a USB-C display port slot (which is optional)

The barebone package without storage cost me 50,- Euro including a power 
adapter (which is sometimes missing, be aware).

Things I needed to add: 

- Storage: WD_BLACK SN770 NVMe SSD 1 TB
- Memory: Kingston FURY Impact 32GB (2x16GB) 3200MHz DDR4
- Wifi card: Intel Wireless-AC 9260
- Antennas: IPEX-4 IPEX Antenna IPEX4 Port 2.4/5G f√ºr

The memory cost more than the actual computer but I thought why not max out
the capacity. Same is true for the hard drive but this can be reused in 
different other machines if necessary.  

In total I paid about 200 Euros for the device.
